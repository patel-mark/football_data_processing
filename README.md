> A streamlined pipeline to clean, merge, and format raw football (soccer) statistics from multiple leagues into a standardized format for analytics or modeling.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project processes raw `.csv` stats downloaded (e.g., from FBRef or similar sources) into league-wide datasets that match a standardized schema. It consolidates raw, fragmented match data across multiple leagues into clean, merged, and analysis-ready files.

### ✅ Main Goals:
- Standardize stats across leagues and seasons
- Merge multiple stat categories per league
- Prepare clean outputs for use in modeling or BI tools

## 🧠 Features

* 📥 Ingests raw `.csv` squad statistics per league
* 🧹 Cleans and standardizes column formats
* 🧩 Merges multiple stat types per league (passing, defense, possession, etc.)
* 📤 Outputs processed `.csv` per league + a unified `Combined_Leagues_Stats.csv`

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

Each league folder (e.g., `Brazil_Serie_A_data`) contains files like:

* `Squad_Passing_Stats.csv`
* `Squad_Defensive_Actions_Stats.csv`
* ... and others

The pipeline does the following:

1. **Loads all stat categories** for a given league.
2. **Matches them on team name + season**.
3. **Merges into a single file per league** with over 100+ features.
4. **Combines all leagues** into `Final_data/Combined_Leagues_Stats.csv`.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tools                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Language     | Python 3.10+           |
| Libraries    | `pandas`, `os`, `glob` |
| Input/Output | CSV                    |

## 📦 Example Output

`Combined_Leagues_Stats.csv` (head):

| League         | Team            | Season | Matches | Goals | xG   | Possession | ... |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------ | ------- | ----- | ---- | ---------- | --- |
| Premier League | Manchester City | 2024   | 38      | 95    | 90.3 | 65.1%      | ... |

Each row is a club-season snapshot with dozens of standardized KPIs.

## 📋 How to Use

> 🔧 Assumes all raw files are already downloaded and placed correctly in `data/Raw_data/<League>`

1. Customize the processing script to your league folder.
2. Run processing logic (not included here—please include your script!).
3. Output files saved to:

   * `data/Processed_data/<league>_merged_squad_stats.csv`
   * `data/Final_data/Combined_Leagues_Stats.csv`
